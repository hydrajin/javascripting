const car = {
  make: 'Honda',
  model: 'Accord',
  year: 2020
}

const keys = Object.keys(car); // Define another variable called keys. I guess object is a function?
console.log(keys); // The 'keys' ['make', 'model', 'year'] are displayed as arrays

// Object.keys() is a protype method. Not sure what that means. 
// Use it when you need the keys of an object
